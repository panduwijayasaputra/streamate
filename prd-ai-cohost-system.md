# AI Co-Host System - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview

**Project Name:** AI Co-Host System  
**Target Market:** Indonesian YouTube Streamers  
**Project Type:** MVP Web Application  
**Primary Goal:** Provide AI-powered co-hosting assistance that responds to viewer chat when mentioned, with real-time chat analysis and character-based personality overlay for OBS integration.

## Problem Statement

Indonesian YouTube streamers face significant challenges:

- **Engagement vs Focus**: Can't respond to all chat messages while playing competitive games or creating content
- **Chat Overwhelm**: High-volume chats become impossible to manage effectively
- **Missed Opportunities**: Important questions, milestones, and community moments get overlooked
- **Language Barriers**: Need support for Indonesian, English, and mixed language interactions with local slang

## Goals

1. **Automated Chat Response**: AI responds when mentioned (@ai_name) with character-specific personality
2. **Smart Content Filtering**: Filter inappropriate, spam, and irrelevant messages before AI processing
3. **Real-time Chat Analysis**: Provide live summaries of chat patterns and trending topics
4. **OBS Integration**: Display AI responses through animated character overlay
5. **Cultural Adaptation**: Support Indonesian language, slang, and cultural context
6. **Secure YouTube Integration**: Safe authentication and direct API connection

## User Stories

1. **As a streamer**, I want the AI to respond when viewers mention it by name so that I can focus on my content while maintaining chat engagement.

2. **As a streamer**, I want to select different AI characters with unique personalities so that my stream has variety and matches my content style.

3. **As a streamer**, I want real-time alerts about chat patterns (e.g., "10 viewers asking about game settings") so that I can address trending topics.

4. **As a streamer**, I want the AI to automatically greet new subscribers so that I don't miss important community moments.

5. **As a streamer**, I want the AI to answer questions with relevant context (gaming, music, etc.) so that viewers get helpful responses.

6. **As a streamer**, I want the AI to understand Indonesian slang and mixed language so that it feels natural to my Indonesian audience.

7. **As a streamer**, I want the AI responses to appear as an animated character overlay in OBS so that my stream looks professional and engaging.

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs

- **Engagement Rate**: Percentage of chat messages that receive AI responses
- **Response Accuracy**: Streamer satisfaction with AI responses (thumbs up/down)
- **Chat Activity**: Increase in messages per minute during AI-active periods
- **Viewer Retention**: Average session duration improvement

### Secondary KPIs

- **Character Usage**: Distribution of character selections

## Open Questions

1. **Character Personalities**: What specific character types would resonate most with Indonesian streamers?
2. **Response Rate Limits**: How frequently should the AI respond to prevent spam?
3. **Content Filtering**: What specific Indonesian content should be filtered (beyond basic profanity)?
4. **OBS Overlay Positioning**: Where should the character overlay appear by default?
5. **Error Handling**: How should the system behave when YouTube API or OpenAI is unavailable?
6. **Data Privacy**: What chat data should be stored vs. processed in real-time only?

## Technical Specifications

### Error Handling & Edge Cases

**API Failure Management:**

- YouTube API quota exceeded: Retry after 1 hour with user notification
- Token expired: Automatic token refresh
- YouTube server error: Fallback to cached data with 5-minute retry
- OpenAI rate limits: Queue messages with 1-minute delay
- OpenAI timeout: Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)

**Stream Interruption Recovery:**

- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- State persistence during disconnections
- Graceful degradation when APIs unavailable
- User notification system for service status

### Real-time Architecture

**WebSocket Configuration:**

- Heartbeat interval: 30 seconds
- Max connections: 1000 per server
- Message queue: 1000 max size with 3 retry attempts
- Rooms pattern: `stream_${userId}` with max 5 clients per room

**Message Processing:**

- In-memory queue with JavaScript arrays
- Priority processing (mentions > general chat)
- Circuit breaker pattern for API protection
- Database-based persistence for reliability

### Content Filtering System

**Indonesian Content Filtering:**

- Profanity filter with Indonesian slang
